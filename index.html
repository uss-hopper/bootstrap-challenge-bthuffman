			<h1>Being British Means....</h1>
			<p>Having a rich culture and history. The British Isles began around 6000 BCE when they separated from mainland Europe due to sea level rises. A few dozen centuries later and the ever famous Stonehenge was built. In 600 BCE the Celtics arrived and began establishing settlements. Going into the AD centuries the isles suffered from multiple Roman invasions, most famously starting with Julius Cesar in 55 BCE. Then into the Medieval era Britain was invaded by even more civilizations including the Saxons, Vikings, and the French led by the famous William the Conqueror. As if to get revenge on the world, Britain would spend the next several centuries conquering other nations and developing the world's largest empire for which the sun only just set on that empire a little over a half century ago. </p>

				<div class="col-12 col-md-7 mb-5">Weighing some 13 tons, Big Ben (pictured left or top depending on your viewport size) is among London's most iconic landmarks. Formally this is home to the Houses of Parliament. Londoner's say it's a spectacular sight at night when the four clock faces are illuminated. Fun fact, the minute hands are 14 feet long, it's timekeeping is strictly regulated by a stack of coins placed on a huge pendulum and the latin words under the clock-face translate to mean "O Lord, keep safe our Queen Victoria the First."</div>

						<div class="card-text m-3 text-center border">Experimental motor bus services first became operational in 1898 and expanded rapidly, eclipsing horse buses within a decade. Apparently competition between bus companies was fierce throughout the early 20th century. The Road Traffic Act 1930 ended that intense period of competition and introduced a new series of regulations to the industry. Today England's cities boast some of the highest uses of buses in the world.  </div>
